# miu_puzzle

This is a mobile app (game) for the [MIU Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU_puzzle) as described in Douglas Hofstadter's _[GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)_ book.

Note, this is rather pointless, and was just a way to try out Flutter and Dart.
